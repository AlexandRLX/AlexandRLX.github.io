### the aim of this book 

the theory of \infnty-categories is a semantic interpretation of the language ofCategory Theory.

the only identification known by syntax is the identity

- there are many rectification model under Quillen equivalence.
\infnty - categories is described by many models.

In the present book, we choose to work with Joyal's model category structure only. this means that our basic language is the one of simplicial sets. 

THe first part of book: the first half of the book consists in following Joyal's journey, step by step: we literally interpret the language of category theory int hte categoy of simplicial sets, 

The reason that we choose this model:this defines canonically a homotopy theory such that all the constructions of interest are homotopy invariant in a suitable sense:
The \infnty-category of functors between two \infnty-categories, the homotopy type of functor is \infnty-groupoid or to see that fully faithful and essentially surjective functors are exactly equivalences of \infnty-categories.

in same vein, starts to speak of right fibrations and of left fibrations.this is an appraoach to the theory of presheaves which is interesting by itself, since it involves(generalisations of) Quillen"s theorems A and B, revisited with Grothendieck"s insight on homotopy Kan extensions(in terms of smooth base change formulas and proper base change formulas) This is were the elementary part ends, in the precise sense that, to go further, some forms of rectification procedure are necessary.

 	In classical category Theory, rectification procedures are of variation on the Yoneda Lemma.
 	The rectification (straightening) of Cartesian fibrations into simplicial contravariant functors is widely used,(this is strongly related to a homotopy theoretic cersion of the Yoneda Lemma for 2-categories.)

 	Rectification is a kind of internalisation: we want to go from \infnty-groupoids (or \infnty-categories), seen as objects of the theory of \infnty-categories, to objects of a suitable '\infnty-category of \infnty-groupoids'(or 'of \infnty-ategories'). This step is non trivial, but it is the only way we can see how objects defined up to homotopy are uniquely(and thus coherently) determinded in a suitable sense. 

 	Rectification thus involves a procedure to construct and compute functors with valuesin the \infnty-category of \infnty-groupoids, together with the construction of a Hom functor. Instead, we observe that there is a purely syntactic version of this correspondence, quite tatutological by nature.we consider the universal left fibration. The codomain of this universal left fibration, denoted by \S, has the property that there is an essen tially tautological correspondence between map X->\S and left fibrations with small fibres Y->X. the objects of \S is small \infnty-groupoids. In the context of ordinary Category Theory, such a category \S would be the category of sets.
 	\S is an \infnty -category which is canonically equivalent to the localisation of the category of simplicial sets by the class of weak homotopy equivalences(hence encodes the homotopy theory of CW-complexes). The tautological correspondence alluded to above can be promoted to an equivalence of \infnty-categories,functorially in any \infnty-category X. rectification of left fibrations is keeping an elementary level of expression.
