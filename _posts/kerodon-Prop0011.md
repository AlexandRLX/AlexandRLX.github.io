\Proposition 0011(when we describe this proporty, we don't use condition of nondegenerate.)
1.degeneracy map must factor through on \delta^{n-1}

Remark 0013: Morphism entre deux simplicial set preserve degeneration. The converse holdf if \f :S_{\battle} --> \T_{\battle} is monomorphism.(evidement)

\Proposition 0014: every section of simlicial sets has a unique decompostion (Prop 0011 + section nondegenerate)

Remark: all of this, we can prove in EZ category as same way.

\Example 002J standard simplex \delta^n is not a Kan complex
reason: because 0-->0 1-->2 2-->1 is morphism of \Lambda -- \delta^2, can't not induce an \Delta^2 ---> \Delta^2

\Example 00H7 Let S_{buttle} be a simplicial set of dimension exactly 1. Then S. is not Kan complex.
Reason: because we need 2-dimension object.

generalization of 00H7, Soit S_{buttle} un simplicial set of dimension exactly n. Then s. is not Kan complex.
