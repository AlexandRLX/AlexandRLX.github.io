\Proposition 0011(when we describe this proporty, we don't use condition of nondegenerate.)
1.degeneracy map must factor through on \delta^{n-1}

Remark 0013: Morphism entre deux simplicial set preserve degeneration. The converse holdf if \f :S_{\battle} --> \T_{\battle} is monomorphism.(evidement)

\Proposition 0014: every section of simlicial sets has a unique decompostion (Prop 0011 + section nondegenerate)

Remark: all of this, we can prove in EZ category as same way.
